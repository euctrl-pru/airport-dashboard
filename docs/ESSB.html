<h3>About Performance Review Unit</h3>
<p>The PRU is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the performance
of the Pan-European ANS system across a number of key performance areas.
As part of the EUROCONTROL Agency, the PRU supports the independent
Performance Review Commission (PRC) in running the EUROCONTROL
Performance Review System and executing the associated PRC work
programme with the appropriate level of independence. The PRU also
provides support to the European Commission (EC) on the SES Performance
and Charging Schemes. In performing its tasks, the PRU maintains
transparent working arrangements with service providers, airspace user
organisations and the industry. Although the PRU is independent, it is
administratively reporting to the Directorate European Civil-Military
Aviation (DECMA). For feedback or questions please contact us at:

<h3>Data and Methodology</h3>
<p>This dashboard is updated on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>IFR traffic data and ATFM delay related data is extracted from the
Network Manager. CDO/CCO data are calculated by the Aviation
Intelligence Unit of EUROCONTROL based on Network Manager data. All
other airport related data is collected through the Airport Operator
Data Flow (APDF). Under the APDF airports are required to report
flight-by-flight data on a monthly basis. The data is reported during
the month following the month of operations. Thus, typically, APDF data
becomes available the 2nd month following the month of operation.</p>
<p><strong>Data and metrics are shown based on availability at the
moment of publication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traffic data comprises all IFR flown flight plans for the airport
(arrivals and departures) based on NM data.</p></li>
<li><p>ATFM delay data captures the arrival ATFM delay triggered by
constraints at the airport based on NM data (<em>no post ops
adjustments</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>ATFM delays are grouped according to the regulation reason as
described in <a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay-codes/"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay-codes/</a></p></li>
<li><p>CDO/CCO performance is calculated by identifying level segments
during the climb and descent. These level segments are considered to be
inefficient. For more information please visit <a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/efficiency/vfe/"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/efficiency/vfe/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Additional ASMA time measures the difference between an observed
travel time elapsing from entering the 40NM radius around the airport to
landing. This time is compared against a reference time to the
respective entry sector, aircraft type, and landing runway. For more
information please visit <a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/methodology/additional-asma-time-pi/"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/methodology/additional-asma-time-pi/</a></p></li>
<li><p>In analogy, additional taxi-times are measured for the taxi-out
and taxi-in phase. The observed taxi times are compared with a
respective reference time. The reference time considers the parking
position and runway used by the departure/arrival. For more information
please visit <a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/additional-taxi-out-time/"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/definition/additional-taxi-out-time/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Pre-departure delay is the delay in the off-block time with
respect to the schedule time for departure. It provides for the airspace
user reported delay reasoning in case of departures blocking off late.
Delay codes have to be provided for delays &gt;= 4 minutes. Most
airports per se do not validate these delay codes, however, effort is
underway to ensure appropriateness of the reported delay codes.<br>
Delay reasons are reported according to the IATA delay codes <a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/library/iata-delay-codes.pdf"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/library/iata-delay-codes.pdf</a>
<br> Delay reported associated to code 89 is used for the calculation of
the ATC pre-departure delay <a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atc-pre-departure-delay/"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atc-pre-departure-delay/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Turnaround shows the time elapsing between an aircraft blocking
in and blocking off for the next flight from the same parking stand on
the same day and the sample is treated to filter out (<a
href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/turnaround/"
class="uri">https://ansperformance.eu/definition/turnaround/</a>)<br>
Other indicators provide additional information on the turnaround
performance:</p>
